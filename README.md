## Overview

Originally Liva was created as a blog template for Hugo by [Gethugothemes](https://gethugothemes.com).

I loved its minimal, clean, and modern design and decided to port it to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to make it more accessible to the community.

It is a simple yet powerful template that is easy to use and customize.

## Removal of Eslint and Prettier

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for formatting and linting.

I found out that Biome gives the same functionality as Eslint and Prettier but in a more modern and efficient way.

It's faster and easier to use - you don't need to configure anything, just run `npx @biomejs/biome init` and you're good to go.

Eslint and Prettier with their configuration files and plugins on this project provided the same functionality as Biome does out of the box.

I completely removed Eslint and Prettier from the project and plan to use Biome in the future for all my projects.


## 🔧Local development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
